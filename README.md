# NeXtCS Project 01
### thinker0: TAHSAN KASHEM

---

### Overview
Your mission is create either:
- Life-like cellular automata [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), [life-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton), [demo](https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://www.netlogoweb.org/assets/modelslib/Sample%20Models/Computer%20Science/Cellular%20Automata/Life.nlogo).
- Breakout/Arkanoid [demo 0](https://elgoog.im/breakout/)  [demo 1](https://www.crazygames.com/game/atari-breakout)
- Space Invaders/Galaga

This project will be completed in phases.  
The first phase will be to work on this document. 
* Use markdown formatting.

## Phase 0: Selection, Analysis & Plan

#### Selected Project: CONWAYS GAME OF LIFE

### Necessary Features
0) 2 classes. 
1) One class that generates 2D array 
2) + class to generate the organisms that populate the cells of the 2D array alive or dead 


YOUR ANSWERS HERE

### Extra Features
1) Using Mouse to arrange organisms and location
2) Being able to use keyboard to run the program ike refreshing/restarting, starting over, creating one
3) A dead cell becomes alive if it has 2 alive neighbors. There is no case for the cell to surive to the next instance of time
A dead cell becomes alive if it has either 2 or 5 alive neighbors. It survives only when there are 4 alive neighbors.


### Array Usage
How will you be using arrays in this project?

1D Array:
- Set up of individualized 

2D Array:
- YOUR ANSWER HERE


### Controls
How will your program be controlled? List all keyboard commands and mouse interactions.

Keyboard Commands:
- r: resets the program, setting up everything randomly
- space: causes the program to run for one instance of time
- c: sets the rules
- k: sets the rules of the program to seeds
- p: sets the rules of the program to the non named rule set.
- w: kills entire grid

Mouse Control:
- Mouse movement: causes movement through hovering
- Mouse pressed: organism at coordinate is alive

### Classes
What classes will you be creating for this project? Include the instance variables and methods that you believe you will need. You will be required to create at least 2 different classes. If you are going to use classes similar to those we've made for previous assignments, you will have to add new features to them.

CLASS Environment
- Instance variables:
  * Organisms [][] grid;  
  * int organismDensity;
- METHODS:
  * constructor (int x, int y, density) // sets the size of the 2D array basedon x, y, and sets organismDensity to density
  * populate (organismDensity) //populates the 2d array based on organismDensity
   - overload both using this ()
  * update () // tells each organism to update its next state based on its neighbors, then a separate loop to tell each organism to update its current state
   - overload this, so that the rule set changes based on which update method you are using, which might requires putting in some parameter from the driver file
  * display () // loops through the array telling each organism to display itself
  * mouseupdate (int mousex, int mousey) // method to change the state of the organism that the mouse clicks to alive

CLASS Organism.
- Instance variables:
  - int currentState // 1 == alive, 0 == dead
  - int nextState // 1 == alive, 0 == dead
  - int size // ideally the size of each organism should be the width that one row fills the entire screen
  - Pvector corner // the corner of each organism, to be later used for display
- METHODS
  - constructor (int x, int y, int sz, int st) // makes the corner into pvecotr (x,y), size to sz, and state = st
  - a display () // fills it color based on its state and then creates a square to represent the organism
  - updateNextState (int neighborState) // updates the organisms next state based on its neighbor
  - changestate () // changes its current state to nextstate
